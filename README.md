# React Minesweeper

I created this project to learn more about React. The project is deployed on GitHub Pages- try it [here](https://ldups.github.io/react-minesweeper/)!

## Resources Used
### React Tutorial

I started learning React through an [Intro to React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-option-2-local-development-environment), which focused on building a Tic Tac Toe game. I extended the concepts I learned in the tutorial through my Minesweeper App. I also based my styling off of the CSS included in the tutorial.

### Create React App

To first create the project, I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
